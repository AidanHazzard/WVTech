# Flipd
## Product Overview
Flipd is an employee search site that allows employers to look for highly qualified employees to fill positions. People looking for a job can add their resume, image, skills, etc. Employees will also have a post page that allows them to let others know what experiences they’ve had with employers and to ask and give advice. 
The purpose of this site is to put hiring power back into the employee. Instead of having the employee search endlessly for jobs and receive dozens of rejection letters, why not have employers look for the people they need? 
## Architecture
This project will be an **ASP.NET Core MVC + SQL Server** project, aligning with our class requirements. 
## External API
- **Auth0** for identity authentication of employers and employees.
## Algorithmic Component
- Allows employers to search based on the skills they want people to have for a position.

### Reversed Job Postings
Add description for reversed job posting
### Product development dashboard
A website to easily create dashboards for the development of products and aggregate information and opinions about the product domain to provide new insights. An example target user would be a game developer, who would want to gain insight into what game genres are popular. Or a bike shop, who would like to know what mountain bike parts are being shared around on social media.
