#### Stakeholders

##### Developers

Developers are responsible for designing, building, testing, and maintaining the app. This includes implementing all required features. The primary developers include the project team members (e.g., Natalie Perez, Easton Pomrankey, Cooper, Aidan Hazzard). They directly shape the system’s functionality and quality.


##### API Providers

API providers supply essential external data and services, including recipes, nutrition information, barcode scanning, and grocery integrations (e.g., TheMealDB, Spoonacular, Instacart). These stakeholders affect system capabilities and limitations.


##### Healthcare or Wellness Organizations

Healthcare and wellness organizations have an indirect interest in the app because it promotes healthier eating habits and nutrition awareness. Their guidelines and messaging may influence user health goals.


##### Nutritionists and Dietitians

Nutritionists and dietitians provide expert knowledge on nutrition, dietary needs, and meal planning.


##### Users

Users are the primary stakeholders. They include people who want to save time, manage groceries, improve nutrition, or stay within a budget. Their needs directly influence feature requirements and design decisions.


##### Owners / Product Sponsors

Owners and sponsors help define the project vision and success criteria. In this case, this role is fulfilled by the project team and the faculty advisor, who guides priorities and approves milestones.


##### Grocery Stores

Grocery stores are indirect stakeholders because shopping list and export features depend on their inventory and pricing systems. Product availability impacts what users can purchase and how accurately lists can be fulfilled.


##### Instacart

Instacart is a third-party integration partner that enables grocery ordering and pickup scheduling. Its API determines how shopping lists are exported and what information is supported.


##### Cooks / Home Meal Preparers

Cooks (including users who prepare meals at home) benefit from recipe organization, interactive cooking steps, and ingredient tracking. Their feedback influences usability, recipe presentation, and preparation workflows.


##### Payment Processors

If premium features or subscriptions are added, payment processors will securely handle financial transactions. They are responsible for payment reliability, compliance, and user trust.


##### Insurance Providers

Insurance providers are indirect stakeholders. While not directly involved, they may benefit from healthier user behavior.


##### Government Regulatory Bodies

Government agencies influence user data privacy, food labeling, and health-related regulations. Compliance with data protection and accessibility laws impacts system design and deployment.
