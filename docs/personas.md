### User Persona 2: Katy Winter (Non-User)

Katy Winter is a woman in her early 20s and a senior in college, who lives in San Marcos, CA. She balances a demanding schedule that includes being a full-time student, working a full-time job, and maintaining a consistent gym routine. Earlier in her college career, Katy struggled to take care of her health due to exhaustion and time constraints, often skipping meals or relying on convenience food after long days of classes and work. That phase of her life has passed.

Now, Katy has established a stable routine that works well for her. She understands her nutritional needs, fuels her body appropriately for workouts, and has developed habits that support both her academic and physical goals. Because of this, Katy prefers flexibility and autonomy when it comes to eating. Rather than following a structured meal plan, she chooses foods intuitively based on how she feels and what her body needs on a given day.

Katy has tried meal planning and meal prepping in the past, but found them too restrictive. She dislikes feeling constrained by predefined meals, especially when spontaneous plans arise. In those situations, meal plans made her feel pressured to eat foods that no longer matched her preferences or schedule.
