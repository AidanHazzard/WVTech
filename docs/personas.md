### User Persona: Katy Winter (Non-User)

Katy Winter is a woman in her early 20s and a college senior who lives in San Marcos, CA. She balances being a full-time student, working a full-time job, and consistently going to the gym. When she began college, Katy struggled to see gym progress due to not fueling herself properly because of her class and work schedule.

Now that she is a college senior, Katy has achieved the gym results she wanted during her freshman year. She understands how to organize her time and what she needs nutritionally to support her fitness goals. Katy has gone through trial and error with meal prepping and planning but found them too restrictive. She felt she did not have room for impromptu plans, and when plans were made, she often could not eat what she wanted because it did not fit into her meal plans.

Because of this, he often chooses whatever is most convenient, relying on takeout or pre-packaged foods.
